# Reasons I use GNU/Linux:

- Opensource nature. You can do whatever you want. You can make sure your kernel isn't spyware infested like Windows or Mac OS (could be), and if you find a bug, you can improve the code yourself, which results in better code.

- Security. Remember that pesky trojan you got a while ago? Or maybe that annoying adware? Even if you have never been infected, chances are you pay for an antivirus to protect your system. With Linux, you don't have to pay for antiviruses, because malware is pretty rare on the system, due to its robustness. And, a consequence of Linux's opensource nature is that if security researchers find a vulnerability in the system, they can submit a patch directly to the kernel maintainers!

- Freedom. No annoying licenses stopping you from doing what you love. No hidden fees or monthly subscriptions. It's free! Most applications on Linux are also free, and a lot are viable alternatives to premium software! You also don't get forced updates, and can update any application with a single click of the mouse, or a 5 word command (more on that later).

- Efficiency. Linux can run on old hardware, and generally runs faster compared to other operating systems on all hardware, old or new. No more system processes hogging all your RAM. Linux runs on pretty much anything! Your smart fridge? It runs Linux!
Your car dashboard? Chances are it runs Linux. 70% of phones run Linux! Even your router probably runs Linux!

- Stability. There's a reason Linux runs most of the worlds servers, and every single supercomputer on the planet! Linux just (almost) never crashes. You can run Linux for decades without restarting a single time! How cool is that? No more constant BSoDs ruining your day!

- Customizability. Do you like your titlebars on the side? Maybe you like changing every icon on the system with a single click. Maybe you want your desktop to stand out! Well, you can do all that with significantly less work than on other operating systems! KDE is known for its customizability, and other desktop environments are also very customizable. Just browse r/UnixPorn on Reddit for a taste of Linux customizability.

- Package management. Continuing from my third point, you can install anything with a single click or command. No more scouring
websites for software! No more fear of getting a virus from a hacked or malicious website! You can update every program on the
system with a single click! 

- Community. Other than a few elitists (mostly in old forums), the Linux community welcomes new users, and helps them with almost anything! If you are lost, you can expect people to help you right away! Communities to get started: r/LinuxForNoobs, AskUbuntu, YouTube.
